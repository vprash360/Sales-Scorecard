Objective
To build an executive dashboard to show closed-won, current pipeline, reps’ performance, or regional managers’ ability  and more to enable their success.

Key Performance Indicators
“How my company is doing?” “Where we are losing money?” Where we are earning good?”
While metrics are important in every aspect of business, they’re especially critical in sales. Sales leaders can’t use their intuition to guide their decisions -- not only are they dealing with a huge amount of information, the risk of failure is too high.
Every sales leader wants to go granular level of data to know insights. Metric can be changed according to the stage of business or the product. Each metric or report should answer one specific question that is useful to take further action, impact.

It was started by identifying which components of the process we can influence:

•	What we're selling 
•	Where we're selling 
•	How we're selling 
•	Revenue and Profit

The main source of the data was from application built on Salesforce. The dashboard was created on PowerBI as BI tool. The ETL part of the project was also handled through PowerBI only. 

I have uploaded the snapshot and a whitepaper to explain the dashboard further.
